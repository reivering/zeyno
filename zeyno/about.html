        <p>Hi, I'm Samvida, a multifaceted designer, systems thinker, and former software engineer based in the GTA. My non-linear path into design shapes my work, grounding it in analysis and empathy. I pivoted into design driven by a deep desire to understand how experiences impact people, who they leave out, and what they would look like if designed more intentionally. This curiosity led me to pursue a master's in Design + Innovation from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I specialized in Design Strategy and explored how businesses can leverage design to create life-centered solutions.</p>
        <p>Growing up in India, circularity and regeneration were more than just sustainability buzzwords; they were the norm. Clothes were handed down, waste was minimal, and every action was embedded with care. When I moved to the United States, the cognitive dissonance in those first few months made me deeply aware of how different the systems were and how many of them still operate on the foundations of exploitative colonialism.</p>
        <p>That awareness now shapes my approach to design. Observing systems through the lens of culture, history, and geography helps me uncover how hierarchy and exclusion manifest in everyday processes. As a certified Sustainability Analyst, I combine this informed global perspective with strategy, research, and design. My focus is on practical interventions that center ethics, transparency, and thoughtful consumption in the fashion and retail sectors.</p>
        <p>Leading with empathy and a holistic approach to problem-solving, I uncover details often overlooked when tackling complex issues. I thrive on making sense of ambiguity and contextualizing it. My goal is not just to solve problems; it is to empower the people involved and infuse care for the planet.</p>
